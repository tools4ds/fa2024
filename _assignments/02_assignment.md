Assignment 2 released on Linear Algebra. 
Here is the [notebook](https://github.com/tools4ds/ds701_fa2024_assignments/blob/main/assignments/assignment02/assignment2.ipynb).

### Special Note for Colab Users


If you are doing this homework on Colab, you will have to take these 3 extra steps:

1. copy this [zipped test folder](https://github.com/tools4ds/ds701_fa2024_assignments/blob/main/assignments/assignment02/hw2_tests.zip)
to your Colab local storage
2. Add a python code cell to unzip it with `!unzip hw2_tests.zip`. You only have
   to run this cell once, so just comment it out after you unzipped the folder.
3. Add another code cell with `!pip install otter-grader`

The last `grader.export` cell will give you an error, but you should be able to 
simply run all cell (except that last one) download your notebook from Colab
and submit the `.ipynb` directly to Gradescope.

Good luck! And reach out on Piazza with any questions or issues.
